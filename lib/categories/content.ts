The algorithms account for century years that are not leap years unless divisible by 400, ensuring accuracy across extended time periods. Month length variations pose another challenge, as months contain 28, 29, 30, or 31 days depending on the specific month and whether it's a leap year.</p>
    
    <p>Time zone calculations require understanding of UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) offsets, daylight saving time rules, and historical time zone changes. Different regions observe daylight saving time at different times, and some regions don't observe it at all. Historical time zone boundaries have changed over time, requiring calculators to account for these variations when processing dates from different eras.</p>
    
    <p>Age calculations involve subtracting birth dates from current dates while accounting for calendar complexities. The process requires determining whether the current date has passed the anniversary of the birth date in the current year, adjusting calculations accordingly. More precise calculations account for the exact time of day, providing age measurements in hours, minutes, and seconds for applications requiring extreme precision.</p>
    
    <p>Date difference calculations involve determining the number of days, weeks, months, or years between two dates. These calculations must account for leap years, varying month lengths, and year boundaries. The algorithms count actual calendar days rather than assuming fixed month or year lengths, ensuring accuracy for both short-term and long-term differences.</p>

    <h3>Real-World Applications and Scenarios</h3>
